  2. Set locale
     
Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8.

  3. Setup sources
You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.
     
    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
    sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

Then add the repository to your sources list.

    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
  4. Install ROS 2 packages

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.
